Built the core functionality (uploading images and normals texts) of original facebook application using reactJS, Material-UI and google
firebase backed application

Built user interface (UI components) using React, used React Hook not to introduce unwanted nesting into the component tree and to
reuse code with encapsulated state

Used React Context API to effectively produce global variables and to pass data through the component tree without having explicitly pass
them through props or using any third-party library

Imported Material-UI and scaled up necessary components using CSS Media query to ensure proper rendering and used different
components of M-UI to create a user interface in react application

Used Flexbox to make a responsive design system, Used CSS-Flexbox module to allow elements to align and distribute space within a
container and used React Flip move to tackle the arduous problems of animating a list of items

Used Firebase - Firestore to create a realtime database
 - Storage to store and sync the data
 - Hosting to allow fast and secure hosting for static and dynamic content
 - Google Authentication for full login in the application
